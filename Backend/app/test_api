python run.py

You should see it running on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`. Leave this running.

#### Terminal 2: Test the Routes with `curl`

In your second terminal, you will run the following commands.

**Step A: Test Signup**

This command sends a `POST` request with JSON data to your signup route.

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/auth/signup \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
    "email": "testuser@example.com",
    "password": "mypassword123",
    "display_name": "Test User",
    "username": "testuser"
}'

**✅ If it works,** you'll get a response like this, which includes your new token:

```json
{
  "message": "User created successfully!",
  "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJleHAi...",
  "user": { ... }
}

**Step B: Test Login**

Now let's log in with the user you just created.

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/auth/login \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
    "email": "testuser@example.com",
    "password": "mypassword123"
}'

**✅ If it works,** you'll get a new token. **Copy this token!**

```json
{
  "message": "Login successful!",
  "token": "COPY_THIS_ENTIRE_LONG_TOKEN_STRING",
  "user": { ... }
}

**Step C: Test the Protected Dashboard (This is the key test!)**

Now, try to access the dashboard. You *must* pass the token you copied from Step B in the `Authorization` header.

Replace `YOUR_TOKEN_HERE` with the token you copied.

```bash
curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/dashboard \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"

**✅ If it works,** you'll get your protected user data:

```json
{
  "message": "Welcome to your dashboard!",
  "user": {
    "id": 1,
    "email": "testuser@example.com",
    ...
  }
}

**Step D: (Optional) Test Dashboard *Without* a Token**

Run this command to see what happens if you forget the token.

```bash
curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/dashboard

**❌ This will correctly fail,** proving your `@token_required` decorator is working:

```json
{
  "message": "Token is missing!"
}
